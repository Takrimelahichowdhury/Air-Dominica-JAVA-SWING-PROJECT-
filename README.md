# Air-Dominica-JAVA-SWING-PROJECT-
This is an Airline-reservation system constructed by Java swing frame. In this project, I use Mysql databse also. This is my 3rd course solo project and quite interesting project because in this project I use any framework very first time.The project is divided into two parts.User & Admin. In user part there are user login/registration part. After login a user can book his tikcet, can watch flight schedule. There is a travel help book also I made for my user.In the admin part there are alos admin login/registratin & after login admin can view all the user who booked their ticket through this app.An admin can also scheduled a flight by using this system which an usercan show it later.
